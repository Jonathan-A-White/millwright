# millwright

A personal software factory: one human directs a small set of AI-occupied
seats that turn conversations into tracked work and tracked work into commits,
across several rigs and two hosts, on a tight fuel budget.

`mw` is the factory's command line. Today it knows its own version, reads and
writes stories through beads, and runs sessions in tmux; dispatching them
follows.

## Getting started

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
make build
bin/mw version
make test
make lint
```

Go 1.27. The only dependencies are [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for
the command line and [godog](https://github.com/cucumber/godog) for the
features.

## Layout

| Directory              | What lives there                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `domain/`              | Value types — Story, Path. Pure: standard library only, no I/O.   |
| `application/`         | Use cases and the ports they reach the world through.             |
| `application/apptest/` | In-memory stand-ins for those ports, for any package's tests.     |
| `infrastructure/`      | Adapters behind those ports: beads, tmux, the harness, the disk.  |
| `cmd/mw/`              | The cobra command tree for the `mw` binary.                       |
| `features/`            | Gherkin features, run by godog from `features/features_test.go`.  |
| `docs/`                | Architecture decision records and research notes.                 |

## Vocabulary

[`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) holds the factory's glossary, and it is law: Seat,
Session, Story, Path, Formula, Rig, Host and Fuel each mean one thing here.
Read it before naming anything. Sessions working this rig should also read
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

## Running a session

`application.Runner` is the port a session is run through: start a command in a
named session with a terminal attached, type into it, read what it has printed,
ask whether it is still running, wait for it to end. `infrastructure/tmux` is
the adapter — one tmux session per story, named after the story's id with the
punctuation tmux reads as a target replaced (`mw-gq6.4` becomes `mw-gq6_4`), so
that a person can `tmux attach -t mw-gq6_4` and watch any story being worked.
tmux is told to keep the window when the command exits, so that the exit status
and the last of the output are still there to be read afterwards.

## The Path

A story is worked by a **Path**: the rig it is worked in, the branch it
targets, and the harness, model, effort, formula and host of the session that
works it. An epic carries default path values and each story may override any
of them; `Story.PathFrom` overlays the two and rejects what is not a path — no
rig, no target branch, or a harness, model or effort the factory does not
know. See `features/path_validation.feature`.
